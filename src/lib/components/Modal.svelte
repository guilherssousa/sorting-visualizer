      <strong>Average running time:</strong> O(n log n)

      <strong>Worst case:</strong> O(n<sup>2</sup>)

  <p>
    Quicksort is an efficient, general-purpose sorting algorithm. Quicksort was
    developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959 and published
    in 1961. It is still a commonly used algorithm for sorting. Overall, it
    is slightly faster than merge sort and heapsort for randomized data, 
    particularly on larger distributions.
